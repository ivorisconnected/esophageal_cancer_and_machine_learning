# esophageal_cancer_and_machine_learning
#
# This repository contains the code for the final project
# of the Data Science, Machine Learning and AI Bootcamp
# carried out @ IDDigitalSchool, Spain.
#
#
# The project explores the possibility of predicting
# the type of esophageal cancer based on demographic,

# using ML classification models.
#
# The repository contains the pre-processing
# and modelling functions used in the process.
